# Cześć!

and welcome to a series of tools created to help scientists analyze single molecule movies.
While much of this software is specific to bio-physical research, significant effort has been made keep these tools scalable.
This work is, and will always be, public. Proper science benefits society, not the individual.
Nonetheless, if you use this tool, please take time to mention Stefan Dalecki and the Falke Lab at CU Boulder.

# Setup
This repo uses Python 3.11. To create a python virtual environment for this repository and install requirements, use the below commands.
```bash
python -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Support

I, Stefan Dalecki, will provide limited support of this repository from 08/22/2022 onward.
It is yet to be determined whether another will take over my role in this project.
If you are interested in building upon this work, contact Dr. Joseph Falke of CU Boulder.
